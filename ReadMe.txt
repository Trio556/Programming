This project contains examples of different programming concepts. So far I've started working on DataStructures like a basic Dictionary, I'm not sure how far I'll take this 
project but it seemed like something fun to do for practice. The classes will be coded using TDD methodology and I'm using Visual Studio 2019 Community edition.
